# Coremats

Yet another FromSoftware formats library for .NET.

This is a personal project with absolutely zero consideration for public use, so there is no documentation, there are no releases, and anything in it is subject to change at any time for any reason.

I wouldn't recommend using it, but if you do, make sure to add it as a git submodule to pin yourself to a specific commit.
